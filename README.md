## Projects

### CNN for Bird Image Classification With Transfer Learning
[Web app](duck-duck-choose.streamlit.app/) | [Github](https://github.com/LarissaHuang/capstone_project)

This project is comprised of 2 parts. Part I (Sprints 1 - 3) focus on EDA, data cleaning and preprocessing, and feature engineering, image background removal and data augmentation, on a simplified dataset of 4 genuses as input to a base CNN model. Part II (Sprint 4) uses a custom transfer learning model leveraging the pre-trained weights of EfficientNetB0 to classify bird species across 75 bird species. The model achieved 100% accuracy with `evaluate()` method from Tensorflow/Keras. On the web app, it achieved greater than 99% accuracy on most species it was trained on. 


### Fraud Detection in Python
[GitHub](https://github.com/LarissaHuang/Fraud-Detection-Python)

This project tackles fraud detection by employing a range of machine learning strategies across both supervised and unsupervised learning domains, alongside text mining. In the realm of supervised learning, the project utilizes models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Unsupervised learning techniques include clustering algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN, with text mining and topic modeling to analyze unstructured text for fraudulent activity detection
